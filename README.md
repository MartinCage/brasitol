# The Pokedex
Welcome to my project called 'The Pokédex'. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD) at HvA. Currently, I am in my third year and enrolled in the Information Design minor. In 6 weeks time I had to learn about working with a framework called Svelte, making API calls, generating charts with the D3 library and learn Javascript overall.

## What is The Pokedex?
This is a project where you can explore interesting data about various Pokémon, based on the data from the [PokemonApi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). You get a list of many pokemons you can choose from. Click on one of the pokemons for a detailed view about them.

The application is build for every device and so called full-responsive.

## Build with
- Git
- D3 Library
- Svelte framework
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
